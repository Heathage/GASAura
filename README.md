Following a Udemy Tutorial to improve personal development skills. 

Due to the nature of it being a tutorial, the majority of the work is not my own original work but instead an opportunity to create a game from start to finish in Unreal Engine 5. Allowing me to develop skills in a variety of areas of the engine and learn more programming concepts and application to a game. 

That being said, this course encourages you to learn and problem solve by issuing challenges by asking individuals to try and solve the implementation of certain problems before telling you how to do them. Which I take every opportunity to do so. Every C++ file has been added by me, and although the majority of them follow the tutorial, there are differences shown in how I prefer to display the info as well as slight differences in how certain syntax is used.

I am finding this great for my own self development.
